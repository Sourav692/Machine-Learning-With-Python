    "Machine learning uses vectors. Vectors are one-dimensional arrays. It can be represented either as a row or as a column array.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are vectors? Vector quantity is the one which is defined by a magnitude and a direction. For example, force is a vector quantity. It is defined by the magnitude of force as well as a direction. It can be represented as an array [a,b] of 2 numbers = [2,180] where ‘a’ may represent the magnitude of 2 Newton and 180 (‘b’) represents the angle in degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example, say a rocket is going up at a slight angle: it has a vertical speed of 5,000 m/s, and also a slight speed towards the East at 10 m/s, and a slight speed towards the North at 50 m/s. The rocket’s velocity may be represented by the following vector: [10, 50, 5000] which represents the speed in each of x, y, and z-direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, vectors have several usages in Machine Learning, most notably to represent observations and predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we built a Machine Learning system to classify videos into 3 categories (good, spam, clickbait) based on what we know about them. For each video, we would have a vector representing what we know about it, such as: [10.5, 5.2, 3.25, 7.0]. This vector could represent a video that lasts 10.5 minutes, but only 5.2% viewers watch for more than a minute, it gets 3.25 views per day on average, and it was flagged 7 times as spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, each axis may have a different meaning. Based on this vector, our Machine Learning system may predict that there is an 80% probability that it is a spam video, 18% that it is clickbait, and 2% that it is a good video. This could be represented as the following vector: class_probabilities = [0.8,0.18,0.02].\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be observed, vectors can be used in Machine Learning to define observations and predictions. The properties representing the video, i.e., duration, percentage of viewers watching for more than a minute are called features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the majority of the time of building machine learning models would be spent in data processing, it is important to be familiar to the libraries that can help in processing such data."

   "source": [
    "In python, a vector can be represented in many ways, the simplest being a regular python list of numbers. Since Machine Learning requires lots of scientific calculations, it is much better to use NumPy’s ndarray, which provides a lot of convenient and optimized implementations of essential mathematical operations on vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectorized operations perform faster than matrix manipulation operations performed using loops in python. For example, to carry out a 100 * 100 matrix multiplication, vector operations using NumPy are two orders of magnitude faster than performing it using loops."
